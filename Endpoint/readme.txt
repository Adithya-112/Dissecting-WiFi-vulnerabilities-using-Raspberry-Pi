First create a folder "endpoint"

In that folder paste these 4 files

create another folder hc22000

Download "Hashcat" and extract it in the enpoint folder

And if you've downloaded any "Wordlists" like in this code we used indian-passwords.txt and rockyou.txt, then paste them inside the hashcat folder (The hashcat folder will look something like this: hashcat-6.2.6)
