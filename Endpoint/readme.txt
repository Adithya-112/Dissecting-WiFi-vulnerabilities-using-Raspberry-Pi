First create a directory "endpoint"

In that directory paste these 4 files

Create another directory "hc22000" inside the endpoint directory

Download "Hashcat" and extract it in the enpoint directory

And if you've downloaded any "Wordlists" like in this code we've used indian-passwords.txt and rockyou.txt, then paste them inside the hashcat directory (The hashcat directory will look something like this: hashcat-6.2.6)
